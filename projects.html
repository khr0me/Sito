            My very first project is a simple light that i made 
            with my friends in 2022. It's a simple circuit with a
            switch and 6 LEDs. It was a very simple project, but
            it was the first one that I made, so it's very important
            to me. <br><br>

            My second project is a simple vacuum cleaner that I made
            in 2023. It's a small vacuum cleaner that I made with a 
            motor, a fan, and a battery. <br><br>

            My third project is a Morse code RF Transmitter that I'm 
            ultimating beacuse I don't have that much free time. 
            It wasn't very simple but I'm sure that i'll finish it
            soon. <br><br>
