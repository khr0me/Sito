    My very first project is a simple light that i made with my friends in 2022.
    It's a simple circuit with a switch and 6 LEDs. It was a very simple
    project, but it was the first one that I made, so it's very important to me.

    My second project is a simple vacuum cleaner that I made in 2023. It's a
    small vacuum cleaner that I made with a motor, a fan, and a battery.

    My third project is a Morse code RF Transmitter that I'm ultimating beacuse
    I don't have that much free time. It wasn't very simple but I'm sure that
    i'll finish it soon. <br /><br />
