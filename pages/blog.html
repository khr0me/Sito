    Hi, I'm khr0me I'm 16 years old, and my passion is IT. I have gained
    experience in some languages in 2023/2034, such as Java, Python, and
    JavaScript; I know a bit of Assembly (8086), HTML, and CSS. I also know the
    basics of C and C++, and I want to improve my experiences in those last two
    and maybe start learning even the older ones :) <br /><br />
    I also love electronics; in fact, I've built some circuits with Arduino and
    Raspberry Pi, and I also love soldering, studying Wi-Fi networks, and
    cracking things.
